        <h1>Michael Jordan</h1>
        <img src="images/michael-jordan-dunk.jpg" alt="Michel Jordan Dunk" style="width:500px;height:250px;"><br>
        <div class="paragrahps">
            <p> Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include five Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations,
                nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game appearances, three All-Star Game MVP Awards, ten scoring titles,
                three steals titles, six NBA Finals MVP Awards, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. Among his numerous accomplishments,
                Jordan holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12  points per game) and highest career playoff scoring
                average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN, and was second to
                Babe Ruth on the Associated Press's list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame,
                having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the 1992 United States
                men's Olympic basketball team ("The Dream Team"). He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015.
